# 🔐 Cipher Visualizer

A React-based frontend application that visualizes a **Caesar-style cipher encoding and decoding process**. Built from a C++ backend logic implementation, this app demonstrates how a queue-based cipher mechanism works, showing users step-by-step how messages are transformed securely.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Accepts any **plaintext input** (letters only)
- Uses a customizable numeric **cipher key**
- **Encodes** messages using a shifting algorithm (case-insensitive)
- **Decodes** ciphered text back to original
- Animates each step of the transformation process
- Highlights how **queues** and **modular arithmetic** are used to secure messages
